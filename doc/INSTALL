In weather/settings.py, change the EMAIL_* fields to reflect your SMTP 
configurations and the email address for sending the Tor Weather notifications. 

In weather.config.config.py, change the listener_port and updater_port ports
to reflect valid control ports in your local torrc file. Ideally, they should 
be different ports.

Look here for documentation concerning how to deploy Django:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/

Once the application is deployed, the listener application should be run from
inside the weather directory:
/weather$ python manage.py runlistener
The listener waits for consensus events from your local TorCtl process, then 
updates the database and sends notifications.
