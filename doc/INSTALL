1) In weather/settings.py, change the EMAIL_* fields to reflect your SMTP 
configurations and the email address for sending the Tor Weather notifications. 

2) In weather.config.config.py, change the listener_port and updater_port 
fields to reflect valid control ports in your local torrc file. These should be 
unique. Change the base_url field to reflect the base URL for the Tor Weather 
application.

3) A copy of (or link to) the TorCtl package must be located within the weather 
directory. 

4) Create the database by running the following command from within the weather
directory:
/weather$ python manage.py syncdb

5) Look here for documentation concerning how to deploy the Django web 
application:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/

6) Once the application is deployed, the listener application should be run from
inside the weather directory:
/weather$ python manage.py runlistener
The listener waits for consensus events from your local TorCtl process, then 
updates the database and sends notifications.
